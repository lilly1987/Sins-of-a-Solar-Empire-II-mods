    "tutorial_exotics.explanation": "These are your Exotics: Tauranite, Indurium, Kalanide, Andvar, and Quarnium. They are used for advanced structures, capital ships, planet items, and more, and are harder to obtain than credits, metal, and crystal.",
    "tutorial_exotics.prod_start": "Let's talk about how they are acquired. Close the exotics window and select your Home Planet to continue.",
    "tutorial_exotics.survey_intro": "This is your Survey button. Surveying is often random, but some planets guarantee Exotic rewards. This helps build Capital Ships early and is your main way to get Exotics until later in the game.",
    "tutorial_exotics.survey_two": "Surveying can also discover other special rewards! Be sure not to neglect them as your discoveries could give you an edge over your opponents. Start Surveying to give it a try.",
    "tutorial_exotics.derelicts": "Another way to acquire Exotics is to capture Derelicts. A Derelict has been located at an adjacent gravity well. Zoom out far enough to see a planet with a yellow indicator on the upper left of its icon. This means a Derelict is present. Zoom in to the Derelict located in the planet's gravity well. It will be a gray triangular shaped icon with a gray circle around it.",
    "tutorial_exotics.derelicts_two": "This is a Derelict. They are always guarded by Scavengers who are looking to profit from their find. You will have to fight through them to get it for yourself.",
    "tutorial_exotics.derelicts_three": "Capturing Derelicts (see the Derelicts Tutorial) is another great way to get early access to Exotics.",
    "tutorial_exotics.factory_one": "Another important way to acquire Exotics is to build them yourself in Exotic Refineries. In order to do this, we will need to research the correct technology, then build a refinery. Let's get started. Open the Civilian Research window to continue.",
    "tutorial_exotics.factory_three": "Exotic creation is quite advanced so it's locked behind Civilian Research Tier 3. For the purposes of this tutorial, you have infinite Research Points. Go ahead and queue up research tier 3 to continue.",

    "tutorial_exotics.factory_four": "Great! Press Escape, Select your Home Planet, and open the Build Orbital Structures window.",
    "tutorial_exotics.factory_five": "Very good. As you can see, the Exotic Refinery icon is now unlocked. Build an Exotic Refinery to continue.",
    "tutorial_exotics.factory_six": "Exotic Refineries convert basic resources into Exotics. Each refinery makes one exotic at a time, so you'll need several for a strong exotic economy. The ability to make exotics on demand is invaluable. Let's queue one up. Open your Exotics window to continue.",

    "tutorial_economy.vasari_note": "The Vasari, however, do not need to use Credits and primarily rely on Metal and Crystal. While they can use Credits with the Market, it is not a necessity for them.",
    "tutorial_economy.tooltips": "Hovering over each resource in the resource window shows its income rate. Each planet generates a certain amount per second. To succeed, you must maximize this number.",
    "tutorial_economy.tax": "As your economy grows, you will incur infrastructure taxes based on your income, not your ships or fleet supply. It's a marginal tax system where higher income is taxed at higher rates. Initially, your tax rate will be 0 as your income will low.",
    "tutorial_economy.transition": "Let's talk about how to produce more resources from your planet. Select your Home Planet to continue.",

    "tutorial_economy.mining_track_two": "Once this Track is completed, your planet will produce more Metal and Crystal per second and is your primary way to acquire these resources.",
    "tutorial_economy.credits_track": "This is your Commerce Track. It functions similarly to the Mining track, except it governs your Credits production, rather than Metal and Crystal. Upgrade your Commerce Track to continue.",

    "tutorial_economy.asteroid_structures_one": "Another way to increase resource production is by using orbital extractors. These advanced structures need research but are unlocked for this tutorial. Press Escape, Select your Home Planet, go to the Structures menu, and build an Metal Extractor to continue.",
    "tutorial_economy.asteroid_structures_two": "You can build Extractors on each resource asteroid a planet has, but they cost Logistics slots. Some planets, like Ice worlds, have more Crystal asteroids, while others, like Volcanic worlds, have more Metal. Consider planet types when planning your empire's growth.",
    "tutorial_economy.market": "Sometimes you just need to buy and sell resources rapidly to achieve your production goals. Luckily, various factions across the galaxy host markets where you can buy and sell Metal and Crystal. However, if someone destroys a faction, their market will vanish with them.",

    "tutorial_combat_model.light_frigate_example": "Display the tooltip for this unit by hovering over the unit itself or the center portrait in the bottom bar of the HUD. The unit has decently high Damage-Per-Second (DPS) and can hit hard in large groups.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.light_frigate_example_two": "In Sins II, all unit weapons are fully simulated. If you zoom in on the Light Frigate, you'll notice it lacks turrets, making it vulnerable to faster Corvettes because it can't rotate fast enough to acquire a target. Now, select and focus on your Kol Battleship to continue.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.kol_example": "The Kol's tooltip shows it has a variety of weapons including light autocannon turrets. These turrets can rotate quickly enough to track Corvettes. However, it has no point defense turrets so it is vulnerable to long range missiles.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.solution": "To protect our units from missiles, build Garda Flak Frigates with fast-tracking point defense turrets to take down missiles and strikecraft. They're not effective against other targets, so they need support. Build some Flak Frigates to continue.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.good": "Excellent. The combat model is deep but when it comes to the basics the next most important factor is Durability.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.durability": "Every unit has a Durability ranking as shown in its tooltip. Durability reflects the quality of its Shields, Armor, and Hull Points. Higher Durability means less damage taken. Weapons with high Pierce can counter high Durability. However, combat isn't just about stats. Select a Corvette to see a simple example..",
    "tutorial_combat_model.durability_two": "Display the Corvette's tooltip and note it has 0 Durability. Corvettes gain their defense primarily through maneuverability. They are very every effective as a 'swarm' unit against targets with fixed or slow moving turrets - even if these weapons have very high DPS or Pierce.",
    "tutorial_combat_model.set_up": "An enemy base has been set up nearby with Assailant missile frigates and a starbase. To take down the starbase, it's best to use Torpedo Cruisers. Let's prepare for this engagement by building some Torpedo Cruisers.",

    "tutorial_fleet.show_fleet_build_window_1": "All Fleet build requests will choose factories best suited to meet these requests based on a number of factors including distance and production backlog. Simply queue up ships to build and your subordinates will handle the rest. You'll never worry about searching for your ship factories again.",
